## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
Covid-19 is a problem that affects the world's population to this day, being especially risky for a certain sector of the population. For this reason, we have designed a smartphone application in which users can calculate the risk of mortality or hospitalization upon contracting the virus based on data such as geographic location, gender, age and chronic diseases.

## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This application calculates the risk of mortality or hospitalization upon contracting the virus based on data such as geographic location, gender, age and chronic diseases. Thanks to the application's risk calculation, the user will receive personalized alerts with recommendations for their day-to-day life, it shows confirmed cases, active cases and deaths in the population with respect to Covid-19 to date.
In addition, through graphs the user will be able to find important data such as the increase or decrease of active cases in the week in their locality or the states with more contagions. We hope that the application can be updated with global data so that it can be used worldwide. So a person in India or someone in Spain can use it. People should be aware of the danger of this disease, and we hope that with our application they can see it clearly and prevent themselves to avoid more deaths, and thus be able to return little by little to have more social interactions without danger. 

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
As a first view of the application there will be data that will not be loaded until the user fills in the necessary data to be able to make a data query.
The first time the user logs in they will have to access their profile to capture their age, gender, location and possible chronic diseases, once captured this data will be stored in the cache and will not need to be filled in again if they leave the application.
Once these data have been stored, the application will be able to consult the database and perform the algorithm to calculate the risk of mortality or hospitalization in the users.
To calculate the percentage of risk of mortality, using the national data obtained, we make a rule of three taking into account mortality and intensive cases of patients with the same factors with respect to confirmed cases in their location.
In addition, you can consult global and national data on confirmed covid-19 data, and it shows tips on how to stay safe.
### For the development of this project we have made use of tools such as:
- Git
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- PHP
- Apache
- Datatables
- Chart.js
- Google Cloud
#### You can try the application directly from our page: https://atvpandemic.co/

## SPACE AGENCY DATA
The geographical focus of the application is in Mexico, due to the availability of data for this country, however, sources provided by NASA were also used to obtain more global data such as confirmed cases and deaths globally.

## HACKATHON JOURNEY
### OUR EXPERIENCE
Many people don't care so much about being infected with Covid-19, but we are all afraid that a loved one will seriously suffer from this disease, which could lead to their death. That is why we were inspired by this project specifically, together with the challenge to develop an application. 
For us, participating in this experience helped us learn many things, especially about programming and databases. Each of us worked at home editing code through a GitHub repository, which we learned to use on this journey. A big problem that we faced at the beginning was not finding information about Covid-19 in our country from the data provided at NASA, so we decided to focus on finding national data first. We spent many hours behind our computers to finish everything necessary for this challenge, and every time we saw our progress we felt very satisfied with our effort. For this, we want to thank the University of Colima for introducing us to this new experience.
